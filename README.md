# URL Tracker

This Chrome extension allows users to save sites that they want to revisit in the future. This tool is more convenient when compared to bookmarking a URL since these links are designed to be stored temporarily. Use cases include compiling a shopping list or saving LinkedIn profiles.

## Usage

Users can both input their own URLs or, more conveniently, save the URL of their current tab. Double clicking the **DELETE ALL** button clears the current list of saved URLs.

## Technologies

This project is written with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6. It utilizes the [chrome.tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/) API to allow for interaction with Google Chrome's tab system.

## Setup

1. Download the zipped version of this repository - navigate to Code section (found on top right of page).
2. Unzip folder in a directory that is not prone for accidental deletion.
3. On Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions` in address bar & toggle developer mode
4. Click `load unpacked` button on top left of page & select folder that contains the source code for the extension.
5. Extension should load into browser - be sure to pin extension for easy access.
